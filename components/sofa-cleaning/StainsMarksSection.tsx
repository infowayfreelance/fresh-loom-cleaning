            <p>A small spill can quickly become the first thing you notice whenever you look at your sofa.</p>
            <p>
              Different substances behave differently on fabric. Coffee may soak into fibres differently from grease, food or pet-related marks, and previous DIY products can also affect how a stain responds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our sofa stain cleaning approach considers the mark as well as the surrounding fabric before treatment begins. Where suitable, targeted sofa stain treatment can be used alongside the main cleaning process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way a mark responds depends on several factors, including what caused it, the
              upholstery material, how long it has been present and whether another cleaning
              product has already been used. For marks affecting carpets rather than furniture,
              see our{" "}

            Professional treatment can improve many marks, but some substances can permanently
            alter fabric fibres or colour. Never promise complete stain removal before the
            upholstery has been assessed.
