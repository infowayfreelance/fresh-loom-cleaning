            Choosing the Right Cleaning Method for Your Sofa
          </h2>

            <p>Customers often search for sofa steam cleaning, but the best cleaning method depends on the sofa itself.</p>
            <p>
              Fabric type, construction, colour stability and the condition of the upholstery can all influence how the furniture should be treated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some professional cleaning methods use hot water extraction or equipment that customers commonly describe as steam cleaning. Other fabrics may require a different approach.

              Fresh Loom Carpet Cleaning focuses on the sofa first rather than automatically using one method for every piece of furniture.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are unsure what type of fabric you have, we can consider that before deciding how the sofa should be cleaned.

              The sofa determines the cleaning approach — not the other way around.
