            <p>
              Wool carpets need careful treatment. Their fibres can react differently to excessive
              moisture, heat and unsuitable cleaning products, which is why they should not simply
              be cleaned in the same way as every synthetic carpet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our wool carpet cleaning approach starts with the carpet itself. We consider its
              condition and construction before selecting an appropriate cleaning method.
            </p>
            <p>
              For customers with wool flooring, our professional wool carpet cleaning service
              focuses on effective cleaning while taking the characteristics of the fibre into
              account.
