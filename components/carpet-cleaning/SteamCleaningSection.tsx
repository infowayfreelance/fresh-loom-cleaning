              Different carpets and situations may require different cleaning methods. Where
              suitable, carpet steam cleaning can form part of a professional deep-cleaning
              approach designed to loosen dirt and extract it from the carpet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our professional carpet steam cleaning service is carried out with the carpet&apos;s
              material and condition in mind rather than using exactly the same treatment for
              every job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers sometimes use the term steam carpet cleaning to describe hot-water
              extraction and other professional methods. What matters most is choosing an
              appropriate method for the carpet rather than simply using the strongest possible
              treatment.
