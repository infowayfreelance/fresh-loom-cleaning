            <p>Curtains can stay in place for years, which means gradual build-up is easy to overlook.</p>
            <p>
              Fabric close to frequently opened windows may collect more airborne particles. Lower sections encounter household activity, while folds can hold fine dust that is difficult to reach through surface cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>Deep curtain cleaning gives suitable curtains more thorough attention when they need more than routine maintenance.</p>
            <p>
              The goal is not to apply the strongest possible treatment. It is to understand the fabric and choose an approach appropriate for the curtains in front of us.

            <p>
              The fabric and construction remain central to every decision.
