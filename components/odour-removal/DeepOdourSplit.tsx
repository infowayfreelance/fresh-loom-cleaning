            When a Persistent Smell Needs More Attention

            <p>Some odours disappear after routine cleaning. Others return because the source sits deeper within the material.</p>
            <p>
              This can happen after repeated pet accidents, large liquid spills, long-term smoke exposure or when a smell has been present for some time.
            </p>
            <p>A deep odour treatment approach focuses on the areas most likely to be contributing to the problem instead of simply adding more fragrance.</p>
            <p>
              The final result depends on how deeply the source has travelled and whether materials beneath the visible surface have also been affected. In some cases, professional treatment can make a significant improvement. In others, contamination below the surface may limit what cleaning alone can achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would rather explain that clearly than promise that every persistent smell will disappear completely.
