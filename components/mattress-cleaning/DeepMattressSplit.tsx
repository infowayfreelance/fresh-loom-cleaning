            <p>Mattress furniture rarely becomes dirty evenly.</p>
            <p>
              A favourite seat may receive daily use while another is hardly touched. Armrests and headrests can darken through repeated contact.
            </p>
            <p>Professional mattress sofa cleaning can give high-contact areas focused attention while considering surrounding mattress.</p>
            <p>
              The aim is not aggressive scrubbing or making older mattress look new, but careful removal of suitable surface build-up while respecting the finish.

              Existing wear and natural characteristics remain part of the assessment.
