            Careful Cleaning for Wool &amp; Area Rugs

            <p>
              Some rugs deserve a more considered approach because of the fibres and construction
              used to make them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wool is a good example. Natural wool fibres have characteristics that should be
              considered when choosing cleaning products, moisture levels and treatment methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our wool rug cleaning approach begins by looking at the rug rather than assuming it
              can be treated like a standard synthetic floor covering.
            </p>
            <p>
              For suitable rugs, professional wool rug cleaning can help remove accumulated dirt
              while respecting the characteristics of the natural fibres.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also provide area rug cleaning for suitable rugs used throughout living rooms,
              bedrooms and other spaces.
