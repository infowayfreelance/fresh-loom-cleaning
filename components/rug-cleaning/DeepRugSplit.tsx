            <p>Rugs in living rooms, hallways and other busy spaces can take a surprising amount of wear.</p>
            <p>
              Repeated foot traffic can push dirt further between the fibres, while everyday
              spills and general use can gradually affect the rug&apos;s appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
              A deep rug cleaning approach is intended for rugs that need more attention than
              routine vacuuming can provide.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to deep clean a rug, the material should be considered before deciding
              how that cleaning will be carried out. Stronger treatment is not automatically
              better, especially with more delicate fibres.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our focus is on cleaning the rug carefully and achieving a realistic improvement
              based on its existing condition.
