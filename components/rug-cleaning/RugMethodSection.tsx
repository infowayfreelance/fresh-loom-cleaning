            The Right Cleaning Method Starts with the Rug
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-600 mb-6">
            <p>There is no single cleaning method that is automatically right for every rug.</p>
            <p>
              Material, dyes, backing, construction and overall condition can all influence how a
              rug should be treated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Terms such as rug washing and rug dry cleaning are often used when people look for
              ways to have a rug professionally cleaned, but the important question is not simply
              which method sounds best.
            </p>
            <p>The right approach is the one that suits the individual rug.</p>
            <p>
              That is why we prefer to consider the rug itself before deciding how cleaning should
              be carried out.

              We choose the approach around the rug — not the rug around the cleaning method.
