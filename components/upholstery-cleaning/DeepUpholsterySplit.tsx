            Deep Cleaning for Everyday Furniture
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-600 mb-8">
            <p>The furniture used most often is usually the first to show signs of everyday life.</p>
            <p>
              Favourite seats can become duller than surrounding areas. Armrests may develop
              darker patches from repeated contact, while cushions can collect small marks and
              general grime.
            </p>
            <p>Deep upholstery cleaning gives these areas more attention than a simple surface refresh.</p>
            <p>
              Our approach is particularly useful for well-used sofas, armchairs and other fabric
              furniture where ordinary household cleaning is no longer producing the result you
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focus on improving the actual condition of the upholstery rather than making
              unrealistic promises about making older furniture look brand new.
