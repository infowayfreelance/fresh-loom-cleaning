              A drink may spill on one cushion while the rest of the sofa remains clean. Armrests
              may show more wear than the back of a chair. A favourite seat may simply need more
              attention because it is used every day.

              During professional upholstery cleaning, these problem areas can be identified and
              treated individually where appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way a mark responds depends on several factors, including what caused it, the
              upholstery material, how long it has been present and whether another cleaning
              product has already been used. For marks affecting carpets rather than furniture,
              see our{" "}

            Professional treatment can improve many marks, but some substances can permanently
            alter fabric fibres or colour. Never promise complete stain removal before the
            upholstery has been assessed.
